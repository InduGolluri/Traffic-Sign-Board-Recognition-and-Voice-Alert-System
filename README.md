# Traffic-Sign-Board-Recognition-and-Voice-Alert-System

##### Hey , Hello Everyone

### Overview
The Traffic Sign Board Recognition and Voice Alert System is designed to improve road safety. It recognizes traffic signs in real-time and gives audio alerts to drivers. By using computer vision and machine learning, the system helps drivers stay informed about important signs while driving.

### Objectives
- *Real-time Recognition*: Accurately identify traffic signs as they appear on the road.
- *Voice Alerts*: Provide spoken alerts for recognized signs so drivers can focus on driving.
- *Safety Enhancement*: Help drivers stay aware of traffic rules and warnings to improve safety on the roads.

## Keywords
-Traffic Sign Recognition, Convolutional Neural Network, GTSRB Dataset, Traffic Signs, Voice Alert, object detection.
### Technology Stack

- *Programming Language*: Python
- *Libraries and Frameworks*:
  - *OpenCV*: Image processing and computer vision
  - *TensorFlow / Keras*: Deep learning model development
  - *Pygame / Pyttsx3*: Audio output for voice alerts
### Components of the System

1. *Camera Input*:
   - Captures real-time video of the road using a webcam or smartphone camera.
   - Feeds images to the recognition algorithm.

2. *Image Processing*:
   - *Preprocessing*: Enhances image quality (e.g., resizing, normalization).
   - *Traffic Sign Detection*: Uses computer vision techniques to identify and isolate traffic signs.

3. *Traffic Sign Recognition*:
   - *Machine Learning Models*: Classifies signs using trained models (e.g., Convolutional Neural Networks).
   - *Training Dataset*: Trained on images of various traffic signs for accuracy.

4. *Voice Alert System*:
   - Generates audio alerts for recognized signs using Text-to-Speech technology (e.g., “Speed limit is 40 km/h”).
  
5. *User Interface (Optional)*:
   - Displays recognized signs and alerts, along with system status (e.g., "Listening for signs...").
